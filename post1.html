        <p>
            Our new piano has arrived. After a break of nearly 12 years my wife and I bought a new piano. Well - a kind of piano.
            We bought a <b>digital</b> piano for several reasons

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                They sound pretty well. Not as good as a real one, but if you compare it to older digital pianos you have to admit that they have come a long way.
            </li>
            <li>
                They are light compared to a real piano. With only
                <ins>50</ins>
                kg they are much lighter than a piano which can weight up to
                <ins>300</ins>
                kg.
            </li>
            <li>
                Headphone support. Even if the sound of piano is very nice, the practice session can sound quite monotonous. So it is great to have the ability to put some
                headphones in it. That way your neighbors don't need to listen to your playing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            The piano of choice
        </h3>
        <p>
            We chose a <i>Kawai CN-29</i> because it has a good sound for a very good price. The hardest decision came down to the choice of color. We took the white one. :)

        <h3>
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
            We are very happy with our choice and we are practicing every day to get better. Well almost every day... :)
